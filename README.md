## Installation 🛠️
Getting started is easy! Just follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dkk934/Python-Algorithm.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Python-Algorithm
    ```
3. **Set up your environment:**
  - Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
  - Optionally, create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🎯
Ready to see the algorithms in action? Here's how:

1. **Navigate to the desired algorithm's directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Graphs
    ```
2. **Run the desired algorithm:**
  - For example, to run a specific algorithm:
    ```bash
    python quick_sort.py
    ```
  - Similarly, you can run algorithms by specifying the appropriate Python script.

## Included Algorithms 📂
Here's a sneak peek at the categories of algorithms you'll find in this project:

 ### Graphs
  This category includes algorithms for traversing and searching through graph structures. These algorithms are fundamental for understanding how to navigate and manipulate graph data       structures, which are widely used in computer science for modeling relationships and connections.

 ### Sorting
  Sorting algorithms are essential for arranging data in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. This category covers various sorting techniques, each with its own advantages     and use cases, helping you understand the trade-offs between different sorting methods.

 ### Trees
  Tree algorithms focus on operations related to tree data structures, such as binary search trees. These algorithms are crucial for efficiently managing hierarchical data and performing    operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
